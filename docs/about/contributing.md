# Contributing to the Clearstone SDK

We're thrilled you're interested in contributing to the Clearstone SDK! Your contributions help us build a more robust and reliable toolkit for the entire AI agent ecosystem. This document provides guidelines to ensure a smooth and effective contribution process.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, and all are valuable. Here are a few ideas:

*   üêõ **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/your-repo/clearstone-sdk/issues) and provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce it.
*   ‚ú® **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea for a new feature, a pre-built policy, or an improvement to an existing one? We'd love to hear it. [Open an issue](https://github.com/your-repo/clearstone-sdk/issues) with the "enhancement" label.
*   üìù **Improving Documentation:** If you find parts of the documentation that are unclear, confusing, or incomplete, a pull request with improvements is highly appreciated.
*   üíª **Contributing Code:** If you're ready to write some code, you can pick up an existing issue or propose a new feature of your own.

## Development Setup

To get started with the codebase, you'll need to set up a local development environment.

#### Prerequisites
*   Git
*   Python 3.10+
*   A fork of the repository.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Fork & Clone the Repository**

    First, fork the repository to your own GitHub account. Then, clone your fork locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clearstone-sdk.git
    cd clearstone-sdk
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**

    It is highly recommended to work inside a Python virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**

    Install the package in "editable" mode along with all development dependencies (like `pytest`, `black`, and `ruff`). This allows you to edit the code and have the changes immediately reflected.
    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

4.  **Run the Test Suite**

    Before making any changes, ensure that the existing test suite passes. This is a crucial first step.
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

## Pull Request Process

We follow a standard, automated pull request workflow.

1.  **Create a Feature Branch**

    Create a new branch from `main` for your changes. Please use a descriptive name.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/my-new-policy-validator
    ```

2.  **Make Your Changes**

    Write your code! Follow the existing code style and structure. Remember to add docstrings and type hints.

3.  **Add or Update Tests**

    Any new feature or bug fix **must** be accompanied by tests.
    *   Bug fixes should include a test that fails without the fix and passes with it.
    *   New features must have corresponding unit or integration tests.

4.  **Format and Lint Your Code (CRITICAL STEP)**

    Before committing, you must run our automated formatting and linting tools. Our CI pipeline will fail your pull request if this step is skipped.
    ```bash
    # Automatically format all code to the project's style
    black .

    # Automatically fix any fixable linting errors
    ruff check . --fix

    # Check for any remaining, non-fixable errors
    ruff check .
    ```

5.  **Ensure All Local Checks Pass**

    Run the full test suite one last time to ensure you haven't introduced any regressions.
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```

6.  **Submit the Pull Request**

    Push your branch to your fork and open a pull request against the `main` branch of the original repository.
    *   Our GitHub Actions CI will automatically run all tests and style checks. All checks must pass before the PR can be merged.
    *   Use a clear and descriptive title (e.g., "feat: Add PolicyMetrics collector for observability").
    *   Provide a detailed description of the changes.
    *   If your PR addresses an existing issue, link it using `Fixes #123`.

## Coding Style Guide

*   Our code style is enforced automatically by **Black** (for formatting) and **Ruff** (for linting).
*   Please run `black .` and `ruff check . --fix` before committing your changes.
*   Docstrings should follow the **Google Python Style Guide**.
