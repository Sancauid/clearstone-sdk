# Time-Travel Debugging

The Time-Travel Debugging pillar allows you to capture complete agent state snapshots and replay execution from any point in history. This enables debugging agents in ways that weren't possible before.

## The Checkpoint System

A **checkpoint** is a complete snapshot of your agent's state at a specific moment in execution. It includes:
- Agent's internal state (memory, configuration, variables)
- Full trace context (all parent spans up to that point)
- Execution metadata (timestamp, version, span ID)
- Serialized state (JSON metadata + pickle state)

## CheckpointManager

The `CheckpointManager` creates, saves, and loads checkpoints.

### Initialization

```python
from clearstone.debugging import CheckpointManager

manager = CheckpointManager(checkpoint_dir=".checkpoints")
```

### Creating a Checkpoint

```python
from clearstone.observability import TracerProvider

provider = TracerProvider(db_path="traces.db")
tracer = provider.get_tracer("my_agent", version="1.0")

with tracer.span("agent_workflow") as root_span:
    trace_id = root_span.trace_id
    
    with tracer.span("step_1") as span1:
        agent.process_step_1()
    
    with tracer.span("step_2") as span2:
        span_id = span2.span_id
        agent.process_step_2()

provider.shutdown()

trace = provider.trace_store.get_trace(trace_id)

checkpoint = manager.create_checkpoint(
    agent=agent,
    trace=trace,
    span_id=span_id
)

checkpoint_path = manager.save_checkpoint(checkpoint)
print(f"Checkpoint saved: {checkpoint_path}")
```

### Loading a Checkpoint

```python
checkpoint = manager.load_checkpoint("t1_ckpt_abc123.ckpt")

print(f"Agent Type: {checkpoint.agent_class_name}")
print(f"Trace ID: {checkpoint.trace.trace_id}")
print(f"Span ID: {checkpoint.span_id}")
print(f"Timestamp: {checkpoint.timestamp}")
```

## ReplayEngine

The `ReplayEngine` restores agent state from a checkpoint and enables interactive debugging.

### Basic Replay

```python
from clearstone.debugging import ReplayEngine

checkpoint = manager.load_checkpoint("t1_ckpt_abc123.ckpt")

# Pass the trace_store to access all spans in the trace
engine = ReplayEngine(checkpoint, trace_store=provider.trace_store)

result = engine.replay_from_checkpoint(
    function_name="process_next_step",
    *args,
    **kwargs
)
```

### Interactive Debugging Session

The `start_debugging_session` method drops you into an interactive `pdb` session with the restored agent state:

```python
# Pass trace_store to access all spans including child spans
engine = ReplayEngine(checkpoint, trace_store=provider.trace_store)

# Define how your trace data maps to your code
mock_config = {
    "llm": "my_app.tools.llm.invoke",
    "tool": "my_app.tools.api.run_tool"
}

engine.start_debugging_session(
    function_to_replay="process_next_step",
    mock_config=mock_config,
    input_data={"query": "test"}
)
```

**When you run this:**
```
--- üï∞Ô∏è Welcome to the Clearstone Time-Travel Debugger ---
  Trace ID: abc123
  Checkpoint: ckpt_xyz (at span: 'process_step_2')
  Agent State: Rehydrated for 'my_app.agent.MyAgent'

Dropping into interactive debugger (pdb). Type 'c' to continue execution from the checkpoint.
------------------------------------------------------------

--- Pre-flight Mock Analysis ---
  - Mocking 'my_app.tools.llm.invoke' (for span_type='llm')
    - Found 3 recorded response(s) in the trace.
  - Mocking 'my_app.tools.api.run_tool' (for span_type='tool')
    - Found 2 recorded response(s) in the trace.
------------------------------------------------------------

> /path/to/agent.py(42)process_next_step()
-> result = self.process(input_data)
(Pdb) print(self.memory)
[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'previous message'}]
(Pdb) next
> /path/to/agent.py(43)process_next_step()
-> return result
(Pdb) continue

------------------------------------------------------------
--- ‚úÖ Replay finished. Final result: {'status': 'success'} ---
```

**Pre-flight Mock Analysis**

Before entering the debugger, the replay engine performs a pre-flight analysis:
- Shows which functions will be mocked
- Displays how many recorded responses were found for each function
- Warns if no responses are found (preventing `StopIteration` errors)

This makes debugging much easier by giving you visibility into what will happen during replay.

## Agent Requirements

For agents to be checkpointable, they must implement two methods:

### get_state()

Returns a dictionary of all state to preserve:

```python
class MyAgent:
    def get_state(self):
        """Return complete agent state."""
        return {
            "memory": self.memory,
            "config": self.config,
            "tool_history": self.tool_history,
            "session_cost": self.session_cost
        }
```

### load_state()

Restores agent from a state dictionary:

```python
class MyAgent:
    def load_state(self, state):
        """Restore agent from state dictionary."""
        self.memory = state["memory"]
        self.config = state["config"]
        self.tool_history = state["tool_history"]
        self.session_cost = state["session_cost"]
```

### Automatic State Capture

If your agent doesn't implement these methods, Clearstone automatically captures `__dict__`:

```python
class SimpleAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = []
        self.count = 0
```

## Deterministic Replay

The `DeterministicExecutionContext` mocks non-deterministic functions to ensure reproducible debugging.

### Automatically Mocked Functions

When replaying from a checkpoint, these are automatically mocked:

**Time Functions:**
```python
import time

time.time()  # Always returns checkpoint timestamp
time.time_ns()
datetime.datetime.now()
```

**Random Functions:**
```python
import random

random.random()  # Always returns 0.5
```

### User-Specified Mock Targets

The replay engine allows you to specify exactly which functions to mock and what values they should return. This is done through the `mock_config` parameter:

```python
from clearstone.debugging import ReplayEngine

# Load checkpoint
checkpoint = manager.load_checkpoint("checkpoint.ckpt")
engine = ReplayEngine(checkpoint)

# Map your trace's span types to your actual code paths
mock_config = {
    "llm": "my_app.tools.llm.invoke",           # LLM calls
    "tool": "my_app.tools.api.run_tool",        # Tool executions
    "database": "my_app.db.query"               # Database queries
}

# The replay engine automatically extracts recorded responses from the trace
# and mocks these functions to return those values in order
engine.start_debugging_session(
    function_to_replay="process_step",
    mock_config=mock_config,
    input_data={"query": "test"}
)
```

**How It Works:**

1. The replay engine scans the checkpoint's trace for spans matching the specified types (e.g., "llm", "tool")
2. It extracts the recorded outputs from those spans in chronological order
3. It patches the specified import paths to return those outputs sequentially
4. Your agent's code calls the functions naturally, but gets deterministic responses

**Error Handling:**

If a mocked function is called more times than there are recorded responses, you'll see:

```
------------------------------------------------------------
--- ‚ùå Replay Failed: StopIteration ---
This usually means a mocked function was called more times than there were recorded responses in the trace.
Please check the 'Pre-flight Mock Analysis' above to see how many responses were found.
```

This clear error message helps you quickly identify:
- Which function ran out of responses
- How many responses were expected vs. actual calls
- Whether your mock configuration is correct

### Direct Context Usage (Advanced)

For more control, you can use `DeterministicExecutionContext` directly:

```python
from clearstone.debugging import DeterministicExecutionContext

# Manually specify mock targets and their return values
mock_targets = {
    "my_app.llm.invoke": ["response1", "response2", "response3"],
    "my_app.api.fetch": [{"data": "result1"}, {"data": "result2"}]
}

with DeterministicExecutionContext(checkpoint, mock_targets):
    result = agent.run()
```

## Complete Example

### 1. Create Agent with Checkpointing

```python
from clearstone.observability import TracerProvider
from clearstone.debugging import CheckpointManager

class ResearchAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = []
        self.total_cost = 0.0
    
    def get_state(self):
        return {
            "memory": self.memory,
            "total_cost": self.total_cost
        }
    
    def load_state(self, state):
        self.memory = state["memory"]
        self.total_cost = state["total_cost"]
    
    def research(self, query):
        self.memory.append({"query": query})
        result = self.call_llm(query)
        self.memory.append({"result": result})
        return result
    
    def call_llm(self, prompt):
        return f"Answer to: {prompt}"

agent = ResearchAgent()

provider = TracerProvider(db_path="research_traces.db")
tracer = provider.get_tracer("research_agent")

with tracer.span("research_workflow") as root_span:
    trace_id = root_span.trace_id
    
    with tracer.span("query_1"):
        agent.research("What is AI safety?")
    
    with tracer.span("query_2") as span:
        checkpoint_span_id = span.span_id
        agent.research("What are the risks?")

provider.shutdown()

manager = CheckpointManager()
trace = provider.trace_store.get_trace(trace_id)
checkpoint = manager.create_checkpoint(agent, trace, checkpoint_span_id)
checkpoint_path = manager.save_checkpoint(checkpoint)

print(f"Checkpoint saved: {checkpoint_path}")
```

### 2. Debug from Checkpoint

```python
from clearstone.debugging import CheckpointManager, ReplayEngine

manager = CheckpointManager()
checkpoint = manager.load_checkpoint(checkpoint_path)

print(f"Agent Memory at Checkpoint:")
for item in checkpoint.agent_state["memory"]:
    print(f"  {item}")

engine = ReplayEngine(checkpoint)

# Map trace span types to your agent's code
mock_config = {
    "llm": "research_agent.call_llm"  # Mock LLM calls
}

engine.start_debugging_session(
    function_to_replay="research",
    mock_config=mock_config,
    query="What are AI alignment solutions?"
)
```

## Advanced Features

### Checkpoint Metadata

Checkpoints include rich metadata:

```python
checkpoint = manager.load_checkpoint("checkpoint.ckpt")

print(f"Created: {checkpoint.timestamp}")
print(f"Agent: {checkpoint.agent_class_name}")
print(f"Module: {checkpoint.agent_module}")
print(f"Trace ID: {checkpoint.trace.trace_id}")
print(f"Span: {checkpoint.span_id}")
```

### Upstream Span Tracking

Checkpoints capture the complete parent span hierarchy:

```python
checkpoint = manager.load_checkpoint("checkpoint.ckpt")

print("Execution History:")
for span in checkpoint.trace.spans:
    print(f"  {span.name} ({span.duration_ms:.2f}ms)")
    print(f"    Attributes: {span.attributes}")
```

### Checkpoint Comparison

Compare agent state at different points:

```python
checkpoint_1 = manager.load_checkpoint("ckpt_step1.ckpt")
checkpoint_2 = manager.load_checkpoint("ckpt_step2.ckpt")

state_1 = checkpoint_1.agent_state
state_2 = checkpoint_2.agent_state

print("Memory Growth:")
print(f"  Step 1: {len(state_1['memory'])} items")
print(f"  Step 2: {len(state_2['memory'])} items")

print("Cost Delta:")
print(f"  Step 1: ${state_1['total_cost']:.2f}")
print(f"  Step 2: ${state_2['total_cost']:.2f}")
print(f"  Delta: ${state_2['total_cost'] - state_1['total_cost']:.2f}")
```

### Conditional Checkpointing

Create checkpoints only when specific conditions are met:

```python
with tracer.span("risky_operation") as span:
    try:
        result = agent.risky_operation()
    except Exception as e:
        span.set_status("ERROR")
        
        provider.shutdown()
        trace = provider.trace_store.get_trace(span.trace_id)
        
        checkpoint = manager.create_checkpoint(agent, trace, span.span_id)
        checkpoint_path = manager.save_checkpoint(checkpoint)
        
        print(f"Error checkpoint saved: {checkpoint_path}")
        raise
```

## Debugging Workflows

### Debugging a Bug

1. **Reproduce the bug with tracing enabled**
```python
provider = TracerProvider(db_path="bug_trace.db")
tracer = provider.get_tracer("agent")

with tracer.span("workflow") as root:
    try:
        agent.run_workflow()
    except BuggyBehaviorError as e:
        checkpoint_span_id = root.span_id
```

2. **Create checkpoint at failure point**
```python
provider.shutdown()
trace = provider.trace_store.get_trace(root.trace_id)
checkpoint = manager.create_checkpoint(agent, trace, checkpoint_span_id)
manager.save_checkpoint(checkpoint)
```

3. **Load checkpoint and debug**
```python
checkpoint = manager.load_checkpoint("checkpoint.ckpt")
engine = ReplayEngine(checkpoint)
engine.start_debugging_session("run_workflow")
```

### Performance Debugging

Find slow operations:

```python
trace = trace_store.get_trace(trace_id)

slow_spans = [
    span for span in trace.spans
    if span.duration_ms > 1000
]

for span in slow_spans:
    checkpoint = manager.create_checkpoint(agent, trace, span.span_id)
    
    print(f"Created checkpoint before slow operation: {span.name}")
    print(f"  Duration: {span.duration_ms:.2f}ms")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Checkpoint Before Critical Operations

```python
with tracer.span("critical_operation") as span:
    checkpoint = manager.create_checkpoint(agent, trace, span.span_id)
    agent.critical_operation()
```

### 2. Name Checkpoints Descriptively

```python
checkpoint_path = manager.save_checkpoint(
    checkpoint,
    filename=f"before_payment_{transaction_id}.ckpt"
)
```

### 3. Clean Up Old Checkpoints

```python
import os
import time

checkpoint_dir = ".checkpoints"
max_age_days = 30

for filename in os.listdir(checkpoint_dir):
    path = os.path.join(checkpoint_dir, filename)
    age_days = (time.time() - os.path.getmtime(path)) / 86400
    
    if age_days > max_age_days:
        os.remove(path)
```

### 4. Use Version Control for Checkpoints

```bash
# .gitignore
.checkpoints/*.ckpt

# Keep only representative checkpoints in version control
git add .checkpoints/baseline_v1.ckpt
```

### 5. Document Checkpoint Purpose

```python
checkpoint.metadata["purpose"] = "Before prod deployment 2024-01-15"
checkpoint.metadata["ticket"] = "JIRA-123"
checkpoint.metadata["notes"] = "Agent was experiencing high costs"
```
