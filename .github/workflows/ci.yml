# --- When to run the workflow ---
on:
  # Run on every push to the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  # Run on every pull request that targets the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# --- What jobs to run ---

  test:
    # The name of the job (you'll see this in the GitHub UI)
    name: Run Tests on Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    # Run this job on the latest version of Ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # This creates a "matrix" of jobs. The workflow will run multiple times,
    # once for each Python version specified here. This ensures our SDK
    # is compatible with all supported Python versions.
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]
